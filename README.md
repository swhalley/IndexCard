# Overview

This is an index card I use for teaching developers how to be more prodcutive in with their time. 
I also used this to teach myself about HTML5 canvases. 

This only works in Chrome and Firefox. Sorry IE users, this isn't for you. This may work in the mobile space. I tried to do a little mobile work but that wasn't the intent of this project. 

# Example
This is deployed to gh-pages. You can run the example here
